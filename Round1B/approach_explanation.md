# Persona-Driven Document Intelligence - Approach Explanation

## Overview

Our solution implements a persona-driven document intelligence system that extracts and ranks document sections based on a specific persona and their job-to-be-done. The system is designed to be generic and work across diverse domains, personas, and tasks.

## Core Methodology

### 1. Document Structure Extraction
- **PDF Processing**: Uses PyMuPDF to extract text content with page-level granularity
- **Heading Detection**: Implements rule-based heading detection using multiple heuristics:
  - Numbered sections (1., 2., etc.)
  - Roman numerals (I., II., etc.)
  - Title case patterns
  - ALL CAPS headings
  - Subsection numbering (1.1, 1.2, etc.)
- **Section Segmentation**: Groups content under detected headings to create structured sections

### 2. Relevance Scoring Algorithm
- **TF-IDF Similarity**: Primary scoring mechanism using cosine similarity between section content and persona+job description
- **Keyword Matching**: Fallback similarity calculation using Jaccard similarity on word sets
- **Domain-Aware Boosting**: Identifies important keywords relevant to different domains (academic, business, technical, medical)
- **Position-Based Weighting**: Earlier sections receive slight importance boost as they often contain key information

### 3. Section Ranking and Selection
- **Multi-Factor Scoring**: Combines content similarity, keyword relevance, and positional importance
- **Adaptive Filtering**: Only includes sections above a relevance threshold (0.1) to ensure quality
- **Top-K Selection**: Limits output to top 20 most relevant sections to maintain focus and performance

### 4. Subsection Analysis
- **Paragraph Segmentation**: Splits section content into meaningful paragraphs
- **Content Refinement**: Creates concise summaries using first 2 sentences or 200 characters
- **Granular Extraction**: Provides both refined text for quick scanning and full text for detailed analysis

## Technical Architecture

### Models and Libraries
- **spaCy (en_core_web_sm)**: Lightweight NLP model for keyword extraction and text processing
- **DistilBERT**: Compact transformer model for sentiment analysis and importance scoring
- **Scikit-learn**: TF-IDF vectorization and similarity calculations
- **PyMuPDF**: Robust PDF text extraction with formatting preservation

### Performance Optimizations
- **Model Size**: All models combined stay well under 1GB limit
- **Processing Efficiency**: Vectorized operations and batch processing where possible
- **Memory Management**: Processes documents sequentially to minimize memory footprint
- **CPU Optimization**: No GPU dependencies, optimized for CPU-only execution

## Adaptability Features

### Cross-Domain Generalization
- **Pattern-Based Heading Detection**: Works across document formats and styles
- **Flexible Keyword Matching**: Adapts to different professional vocabularies
- **Context-Aware Scoring**: Considers both literal keyword matches and semantic similarity

### Persona Sensitivity
- **Role-Specific Boosting**: Recognizes different professional contexts (academic, business, technical)
- **Task-Oriented Filtering**: Prioritizes content relevant to specific job requirements
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Adjusts relevance criteria based on content availability

## Quality Assurance

### Robustness Measures
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks for missing models or processing failures
- **Content Validation**: Ensures minimum content length for meaningful sections
- **Output Consistency**: Standardized JSON format regardless of input variation

### Testing Considerations
- **Multi-Domain Testing**: Designed to handle research papers, business reports, educational content
- **Persona Variety**: Works with different professional roles and expertise levels
- **Scale Flexibility**: Handles document collections from 3-10 PDFs efficiently

This approach ensures reliable, scalable, and adaptable document intelligence that serves diverse user needs while maintaining high performance and accuracy standards.
